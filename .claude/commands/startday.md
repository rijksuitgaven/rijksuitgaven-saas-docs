Start of day briefing. As Project Manager, prepare the session by reviewing all documentation and presenting actionable next steps.

## MANDATORY: Read First (Do Not Skip)

You MUST read these files before presenting the briefing:

1. `rijksuitgaven-saas-docs/logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` - Current status, pending decisions, blockers
2. Most recent file in `rijksuitgaven-saas-docs/logs/daily/` - Last session details
3. `rijksuitgaven-saas-docs/04-target-architecture/RECOMMENDED-TECH-STACK.md` - Current tech decisions
4. `rijksuitgaven-saas-docs/02-requirements/search-requirements.md` - Search feature specs

## Additional Reading (Based on Current Phase)

If phase involves UI/wireframes, also read:
- `rijksuitgaven-saas-docs/03-current-state/current-ui-overview.md`
- All images in `rijksuitgaven-saas-docs/assets/screenshots/current-ui/`

If phase involves architecture decisions, also read:
- `rijksuitgaven-saas-docs/04-target-architecture/architecture-impact-analysis.md`

## 3. Check for Blockers
