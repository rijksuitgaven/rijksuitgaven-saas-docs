Start of day briefing. As Project Manager, prepare the session by reviewing all documentation and presenting actionable next steps.

## MANDATORY: Read First (Do Not Skip)

You MUST read these files before presenting the briefing:

1. `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` - Current status, pending decisions, blockers
2. Most recent file in `logs/daily/` - Last session details
3. `04-target-architecture/RECOMMENDED-TECH-STACK.md` - Current tech decisions
4. `02-requirements/search-requirements.md` - Search feature specs

## Additional Reading (Based on Current Phase)

If phase involves UI/wireframes, also read:
- `03-current-state/current-ui-overview.md`
- All images in `assets/screenshots/current-ui/`

If phase involves architecture decisions, also read:
- `04-target-architecture/architecture-impact-analysis.md`

## 3. Check for Blockers

Identify any:
- Unresolved decisions blocking progress
- Missing information needed
- Dependencies on external input

## 4. Present Session Briefing

```
