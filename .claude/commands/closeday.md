Create a comprehensive daily log for today and update session context. Follow this process:

## 0. Documentation Audit (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)

**WE DO NOT CLOSE THE DAY WITHOUT A COMPLETE AUDIT.**

**Documentation must always be up to date.** Before creating logs, verify ALL documentation reflects current decisions.

### Audit Process

1. **Read and verify every relevant file:**
   - `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` - Is status current?
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Do rules reflect current practices?
   - All files created/modified today - Are they complete?
   - Sprint plan - Does progress match reality?
   - Any config files - Are credentials/settings documented?

2. **Check all folders for outdated information:**
   - `01-project-overview/`
   - `02-requirements/`
   - `03-wordpress-baseline/`
   - `04-target-architecture/`
   - `05-v1-design/`
   - `06-technical-specs/`
   - `07-migration-strategy/`
   - `08-decisions/`
   - `09-timelines/`
   - `config/`
   - `scripts/`

3. **Change perspectives** - Switch roles and verify:
   - **Project Manager** → scope, timeline, deliverables, sprint progress
   - **Architect** → technical decisions, ADRs, tech stack consistency
   - **UX Designer** → wireframes, requirements, user flows
   - **Developer** → specs match implementation, code is documented

4. **Single source of truth** - Ensure no duplicate or conflicting information.

### MANDATORY: Ask Questions Until Resolved

**If you have ANY doubt or uncertainty:**
- You MUST ask the user before proceeding
- Do NOT make assumptions
- Do NOT close the day with unresolved questions
- Keep asking until everything is clear

**Examples of things to ask about:**
- "I see X in file A but Y in file B - which is correct?"
- "Today we did X but it's not reflected in the sprint plan - should I update it?"
- "The config file mentions Z but I don't see it documented - is this intentional?"
- "I'm unsure if feature X was completed or just started - can you confirm?"

### Audit Checklist (Must Complete)

- [ ] SESSION-CONTEXT.md reflects today's work

- [ ] All new files are documented
- [ ] All config/credentials are documented (not the secrets, just that they exist)
- [ ] Sprint progress is accurate
- [ ] No conflicting information across files

## 3. Commit EVERYTHING to GitHub

**IMPORTANT:** All project files live in ONE repository: `rijksuitgaven/`

cd /Users/michielmaandag/SynologyDrive/code/watchtower/rijksuitgaven
git add -A
git status  # Verify what will be committed
git commit -m "Daily log YYYY-MM-DD: [brief summary]"
git push
```

**Checklist before committing:**
- [ ] CLAUDE.md changes included
- [ ] All new/modified docs included
- [ ] Daily log included
- [ ] SESSION-CONTEXT.md included
- [ ] No files left uncommitted

**Never leave uncommitted changes.** Everything goes to the repo.
