# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## MANDATORY: Read First (Do Not Skip)

Before any brainstorming, read these files:

1. `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` - Current status, existing decisions
2. `02-requirements/search-requirements.md` - Requirements context
3. `04-target-architecture/RECOMMENDED-TECH-STACK.md` - Tech constraints

If brainstorming UI/UX, also read:
- `03-current-state/current-ui-overview.md`
- All images in `assets/screenshots/current-ui/`

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit the design document to git

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"
- Create detailed implementation plan with tasks

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Starting the Session

When `/brainstorm-mode` is invoked, respond with:

```
## Brainstorm Mode Active

I'll help you turn your idea into a concrete design.

First, let me check the current project context...
[Read SESSION-CONTEXT.md and relevant docs]

**What would you like to brainstorm?**

Describe your idea in a sentence or two, and I'll start asking questions to refine it.
```

## Exiting Brainstorm Mode

Exit when:
- Design is documented and committed
- User says "exit", "done", or "back to normal"
- User starts a different task

On exit, summarize what was accomplished and link to any created documents.
