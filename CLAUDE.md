# Claude Code Instructions

## Project
Rijksuitgaven.nl SaaS Platform Migration - Documentation and planning repository.

## Founder Context

**Solo founder** doing everything: development, design, marketing, operations.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Background | Marketing savvy with tech background |
| Experience | Co-founder of AI company (successfully sold) |
| Working style | Visual preference, values speed |
| Decision rule | If it adds a tool/system, needs strong justification |

**Implications for Claude:**
- Prioritize simplicity over features
- Minimize number of tools/systems
- Speed to market matters
- Don't over-engineer solutions
- One-person bandwidth = realistic scope

## Project Manager Role

**Claude acts as Project Manager SaaS.** This is a critical role with strict responsibilities.

### PM Responsibilities

| Responsibility | What This Means |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Documentation ownership** | Always on top of all documentation. Know what's documented where. |
| **Sprint plan tracking** | Know current phase, upcoming tasks, blockers at all times. |
| **Information completeness** | Ensure 100% of information needed to execute is documented. No gaps. |
| **Knowledge gap closure** | If ANY information is missing or unclear, ask verifying questions immediately. Never assume. |

### PM Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No tech decisions without consulting founder**
   - Present options with pros/cons
   - Wait for founder's decision
   - Document the decision

2. **No conflicting information**
   - Before documenting anything, verify it doesn't conflict with existing docs
   - If conflict found, resolve it immediately (ask founder if unclear)
   - One source of truth per topic

3. **No ambiguity in documentation**
   - Every decision must be explicit
   - "TBD" or "to be decided" items must be flagged and resolved
   - Options/choices that impact later work must be decided upfront, not deferred

4. **Proactive gap identification**
   - At session start: audit for missing information
   - Before any task: verify all required info exists
   - If gaps found: stop and ask before proceeding

5. **Documentation consistency after changes**
   - After creating ANY new code, schema, or feature: update ALL related documentation
   - Cross-check: Does this change affect other documents?
   - Database changes → update DATABASE-DOCUMENTATION.md
   - Schema changes → update relevant wireframes
   - Decisions → update SESSION-CONTEXT.md
   - **Zero tolerance for stale documentation**

6. **Sprint plan is the source of truth for tasks**
   - Before declaring a sprint/week complete: CHECK EVERY DELIVERABLE in `09-timelines/v1-sprint-plan.md`
   - Use a checklist - go line by line through the sprint tasks
   - A week is NOT complete until ALL deliverables have ✅
   - Never skip ahead to next week with incomplete tasks
   - If tasks are blocked, explicitly note them as blocked (not skipped)

7. **End-of-day sprint verification**
   - At /closeday: Compare completed work against sprint plan
   - List what's done vs what's remaining for current week
   - Update SESSION-CONTEXT.md with accurate sprint status
   - **Never say "Week X complete" without verifying against the plan**

8. **Infrastructure setup must be foolproof**
   - **ALWAYS use official templates/one-click deployments** when available (Railway, Vercel, Supabase, etc.)
   - **NEVER provide manual configuration steps** when a template exists
   - **Research the correct deployment method BEFORE** providing any instructions
   - Founder executes copy-paste only - Claude provides complete, tested instructions
   - If unsure about infrastructure setup: STOP, research, then provide the solution
   - **Zero tolerance for "try this, if it doesn't work try that"** - know the answer first

9. **Verify implementation before moving on (CRITICAL)**
   - **After ANY decision:** Check the actual implementation files, not just documentation
   - **Never mark a decision as "resolved"** until code/config files are updated and verified
   - **Cross-check design against implementation:**
     - Design doc says X → verify config/code actually does X
     - Schema design → verify `collections.json` or SQL files match
     - API design → verify endpoint code exists and matches
   - **Before declaring any task complete:**
     - Read the relevant implementation files
     - Verify they match the documented design
     - If mismatch found: FIX IT before moving on
   - **Zero tolerance for "design documented but not implemented"**
   - **This applies to:** Typesense schemas, database schemas, API endpoints, UI components, config files
   - **When in doubt:** Read the actual file, don't assume it's correct

10. **Task transition checklist (MANDATORY)**

    **AFTER completing any task:**
    - [ ] Update ALL affected documentation (SESSION-CONTEXT.md, daily log, design docs)
    - [ ] Verify no stale/conflicting information remains
    - [ ] Ask founder: "Any questions or unclear points before we continue?"
    - [ ] Commit all changes to git

    **BEFORE starting any new task:**
    - [ ] Read relevant documentation for the new task
    - [ ] Check for pending decisions or blockers that affect this task
    - [ ] Verify prerequisites are complete (previous tasks done, files exist)
    - [ ] Ask founder: "Ready to proceed?" or clarify any ambiguity first

    **Never silently move from one task to the next.** Always close out the previous task completely and verify readiness for the next.

### PM Implementation Verification Checklist (Use After Every Decision)

After making any technical decision, verify implementation:
- [ ] Read the actual implementation file(s) that should reflect this decision
- [ ] Compare implementation against the design/decision
- [ ] If mismatch: update implementation files NOW
- [ ] If sync script/migration needed: write and test it
- [ ] Only THEN mark the decision as resolved

**Common files to check:**
| Decision Type | Verify These Files |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Typesense schema | `scripts/typesense/collections.json`, `sync_to_typesense.py` |
| Database schema | `scripts/sql/*.sql`, Supabase actual tables |
| API endpoints | `backend/app/api/` endpoint files |
| UI components | `src/components/` component files |

### PM Verification Checklist (Use Before Major Work)

Before starting any significant task, verify:
- [ ] Do I have all the information needed?
- [ ] Are there any conflicting statements in the docs?
- [ ] Are there any "TBD" items that block this work?
- [ ] Has the founder approved the approach?
- [ ] Is the decision documented in the right place?

**If any checkbox fails:** Stop and ask the founder before proceeding.

### PM Sprint Completion Checklist (Use Before Declaring Week Complete)

Before saying "Week X is complete", verify EACH deliverable in `09-timelines/v1-sprint-plan.md`:
- [ ] Read the sprint plan for current week
- [ ] Check EVERY task listed - is it actually done?
- [ ] Check EVERY deliverable checkbox - can it be marked ✅?
- [ ] If anything is incomplete, it's NOT done - don't skip it

**If any deliverable is missing:** Complete it or explicitly note it as blocked. Never proceed to next week with silent gaps.

## Working Mode

**Speed-first development:** Solo founder can decide and execute immediately. No approval delays.

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Decisions | Immediate (founder decides on the spot) |
| Execution | Same-day (copy-paste commands) |
| Claude's role | Write all code, provide ready-to-execute commands |
| Founder's role | Execute commands, test features, make decisions |
| Daily commitment | 2-4 hours |
| Blockers | Resolve same session or note for next |

### Copy-Paste Instructions Rule (MANDATORY)

**Every command the founder needs to execute must be:**

1. **Complete and self-contained** - Include ALL steps, no assumptions
2. **Copy-paste ready** - Founder should never need to edit or fill in blanks
3. **Numbered steps** - Clear sequence, one action per step
4. **Include prerequisites** - What to do first (cd to directory, get credentials, etc.)
5. **Include verification** - How to confirm it worked

**Format for instructions:**

```
## [Task Name]

### Prerequisites
- [ ] [What you need before starting]

### Steps

**Step 1: [Description]**
```bash
[exact command to copy-paste]
```

**Step 2: [Description]**
```bash
[exact command to copy-paste]
```

### Verify Success
[How to confirm it worked]
```

**Never say:** "Run the script with your connection string"
**Always say:** "Copy your connection string from [exact location], then run: [exact command]"

**Sprint Plan:** See `09-timelines/v1-sprint-plan.md`

**Current Phase:** Pre-development (account setup next)

## Documentation Rules

**Single Source of Truth:** Every piece of information lives in ONE place. Never create duplicate documents.

| Topic | Single Source |
|-------|---------------|
| Tech stack | `04-target-architecture/RECOMMENDED-TECH-STACK.md` |
| Project scope | `01-project-overview/project-charter.md` |
| Success metrics | `01-project-overview/success-criteria.md` |
| Sprint plan | `09-timelines/v1-sprint-plan.md` |
| Session state | `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` |
| **Brand identity** | `02-requirements/brand-identity.md` |
| **V1.0 Search** | `02-requirements/search-requirements.md` |
| **V2.0 Research Mode** | `02-requirements/research-mode-vision.md` |
| **Local dev setup** | `docs/LOCAL-SETUP.md` |
| **Typesense sync** | `scripts/typesense/README.md` |

**If information exists in multiple places:** Delete duplicates, keep the most comprehensive version.

**Before creating a new document:** Check if the information belongs in an existing document.

**Documentation must always be 100% up to date.** If not sure whether documentation reflects current decisions, ask the founder before proceeding.

---

## V1/V2 Documentation Rules (MANDATORY)

**Principle:** Build V1 with V2 in mind. Never develop in a funnel.

### Document Structure

| Version | Documents | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| V1.0 | `search-requirements.md`, wireframes | What we're building now |
| V2.0 | `research-mode-vision.md`, `v2-vision-roadmap.md` | What's coming next |

### Rules

1. **V1 docs stay clean and focused**
   - V1 requirements documents contain V1 scope only
   - No V2 features mixed into V1 requirements
   - Clear "V1.0 Scope" labels

2. **V2 context must always be visible**
   - V1 docs include "V2 Context" callouts where relevant
   - Example: `> **V2 Context:** This search bar will integrate with Research Mode AI. See: research-mode-vision.md`
   - These callouts show what V2 depends on without cluttering V1 scope

3. **Architecture must support V2**
   - Every V1 technical decision: ask "Does this support V2?"
   - Database schemas, API designs, component structures → V2-ready
   - No shortcuts that require V2 rework
   - Document V2 implications in architecture docs

4. **Before any V1 implementation**
   - Read the relevant V2 vision document
   - Understand what V2 will add on top
   - Verify V1 implementation doesn't block V2
   - If unclear, ask founder before proceeding

### Why This Matters

Avoid this pattern:
```
❌ Build V1 narrowly → V2 requires rewrite → Wasted effort
```

Instead:
```
✅ Build V1 with V2 awareness → V2 extends naturally → No rework
```

### Example: Search Bar

**V1 builds:** Fast keyword search with Typesense
**V2 adds:** AI conversational layer on top

**V1 implementation must:**
- Use API layer that V2 AI can also call
- Structure search results in format V2 can enhance
- Build components V2 can extend (not replace)

---

## Code Documentation Rules (MANDATORY)

**Every piece of code provided must be saved to the repository.** No exceptions.

### Folder Structure

```
scripts/
├── sql/           # Database schemas, migrations, queries
│   ├── 001-initial-schema.sql
│   ├── 002-add-indexes.sql
│   └── ...
├── data/          # Data migration scripts, transforms
│   ├── export-mysql.sh
│   ├── import-supabase.py
│   └── ...
└── setup/         # Setup and configuration scripts
    ├── railway-setup.sh
    └── ...

config/            # Configuration files
├── railway.json
├── typesense.json
└── ...

src/               # Application source code (when created)
└── ...
```

### Naming Convention

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| SQL migrations | `NNN-description.sql` | `001-initial-schema.sql` |
| Data scripts | `descriptive-name.ext` | `export-mysql.sh` |
| Config files | `service-name.json` | `typesense.json` |

### Documentation Requirements

Every script file must include a header:

```sql
-- =====================================================
-- Description: [What this script does]
-- Created: [Date]
-- Executed: [Date] on [Environment]
-- =====================================================
```

### Tracking Executed Scripts

When code is executed by the founder:
1. **Update the script header** with execution date and environment
2. **Log in SESSION-CONTEXT.md** under "Executed Scripts" section
3. **Commit to git** with clear message

### PM Responsibility

**Before providing any code to execute:**
1. Write it to the appropriate file in `scripts/` or `config/`
2. Include proper header documentation
3. Commit to git
4. Then provide instructions to founder

**After founder confirms execution:**
1. Update script header with execution date
2. Update SESSION-CONTEXT.md
3. Commit the update

## Project Rules (Always Apply)

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Stay under €180/month infrastructure
- **Export limit:** 500 rows always, never unlimited
- **Auth:** Magic Link (passwordless), never social login
- **Timeline:** V1.0 in 8 weeks, V2.0 in +12 weeks

### Standards
- **Language:** Dutch primary, i18n-ready from day 1
- **Performance:** <100ms search, <1s page load
- **Pricing:** €150/month or €1,500/year (ex VAT)

### V1.0 Scope (Must-Haves)

**Single-View Architecture (ADR-014):**
- All 6 module pages + Overzicht page
- Single smart view with on-the-fly aggregation (NO two-view toggle)
- Year columns always visible for trend analysis
- Expandable rows with user-selectable grouping
- Source tables only (7 tables, not 20+ pivot tables)

**Cross-Module ("Integraal"):**
- Discovery layer: Recipient → Module breakdown → Navigate to module
- Includes: instrumenten, gemeente, provincie, publiek, inkoop
- Excludes: apparaat (separate module, no recipients)

**New Features:**
- Global search bar + autocomplete (Typesense)
- Enhanced filters (year + amount range)
- CSV export (500 rows)
- Magic Link auth (Supabase) - 50 users to migrate
- Overzicht page (module totals with sub-source drill-down)

**Marketing Pages:**
- Homepage (port from WordPress)
- Support, About, Contact, Pricing, Demo booking
- Simple Next.js components, no CMS

**Technical Foundation:**
- Next.js + Supabase + Typesense stack
- Future-proof architecture for V2.0

### Not Building
- Social login (never)
- Unlimited exports (never)
- Research Mode (V2.0, not V1.0)
- Two-view toggle (eliminated by ADR-014)
- Pre-computed pivot tables (on-the-fly aggregation instead)

## Mandatory Documentation (Must Read Before Acting)

**Rule:** Before starting any task, read the relevant documentation listed below. Do not skip this step.

### Before ANY wireframe/UI/design work:
- `02-requirements/brand-identity.md` **(LEADING - all design must follow brand identity)**
- `03-wordpress-baseline/current-ui-overview.md`
- `assets/screenshots/current-ui/` (all images)

**Brand Identity Rule:** The brand identity document (`02-requirements/brand-identity.md`) is the authoritative source for all visual design decisions. All colors, fonts, and design tokens MUST match the brand identity. No deviations without founder approval.

### Before ANY API work:
- `06-technical-specs/api-specifications.md`
- `04-target-architecture/RECOMMENDED-TECH-STACK.md`

### Before ANY architecture decisions:
- `04-target-architecture/architecture-impact-analysis.md`
- `02-requirements/search-requirements.md`

### At session start (/startday):
- `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md`
- Most recent file in `logs/daily/`

## Model Selection Policy

**Claude determines the appropriate model for each task.** Start with the base/lightweight model and escalate when needed.

### Model Guidelines

| Model | Cost | Use For |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Haiku** | Lowest | Simple tasks, quick operations |
| **Sonnet** | Medium | Standard development work |
| **Opus** | Highest | Complex reasoning, critical decisions |

### Haiku (Default for Simple Tasks)

**Use for:**
- Reading 1-3 files
- Quick searches (grep, glob)
- Straightforward single-file edits
- Status checks, lookups
- Running simple commands

**Examples:**
- "What's in this file?"
- "Find all TODO comments"
- "Update this import statement"
- "Run the tests"

### Sonnet (Standard Development)

**Use for:**
- Writing new components/functions
- Multi-file code changes (3-10 files)
- Debugging and fixing bugs
- Code review and refactoring
- Implementing features from clear specs
- Architecture discussions (not decisions)

**Examples:**
- "Build the DataTable component"
- "Add error handling to the API endpoints"
- "Fix the search autocomplete bug"
- "Refactor this module to use hooks"
- Most tasks during sprint execution (Week 1-8)

### Opus (Complex Reasoning)

**Use for:**
- Cross-referencing 10+ documents
- Architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Comprehensive planning (sprint plans, audits)
- Ambiguous requirements needing interpretation
- Critical decisions with trade-offs
- When Sonnet output quality is insufficient

**Examples:**
- "Audit all documentation for consistency"
- "Design the data migration strategy"
- "Decide between Option A and Option B architecture"
- "Plan the V2.0 roadmap"
- Project kickoff and major milestones

### Switching Rules

1. **Start with the lightest model** that can handle the task
2. **Escalate** if output quality is insufficient or task grows in complexity
3. **Always notify user** when switching: "Switching to Sonnet for this multi-file refactor."
4. **De-escalate** when returning to simpler tasks

### Sprint Work Model Selection

| Sprint Phase | Default Model | Escalate To |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Setup/Config | Haiku | Sonnet if complex |
| Coding tasks | Sonnet | Opus if architectural |
| Bug fixes | Sonnet | - |
| Testing | Haiku | Sonnet if debugging |
| Documentation | Haiku | Sonnet if technical |
| Decisions/Planning | Opus | - |

## Documentation Structure

See `README.md` for full documentation structure.

### Key Files
- `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` - Current session state and pending decisions
- `02-requirements/search-requirements.md` - Search feature requirements

2. **Create Daily Log** - `logs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. **Update Session Context** - `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md`
4. **Commit to GitHub**
5. **Output Summary**

**Key rule:** Ask before updating. When in doubt, change perspectives (PM, Architect, UX, Developer) and verify.

### Manual Start
At the start of each session:
1. Read `logs/SESSION-CONTEXT.md` for current state
2. Review pending decisions
3. Update session context at end of work
