## Work Completed

### 1. Cookie Banner Design (Brainstorm)

Designed simple cookie disclosure banner for V1.0 GDPR compliance.

**Key decisions:**
- Essential cookies only (no consent mechanism needed)
- Simple bottom bar with dismiss button
- Self-host fonts via next/font (no Google data transfer)
- localStorage persistence (never re-displays)

**Text:** "Deze website gebruikt alleen noodzakelijke cookies voor het functioneren van de site."

**Design document:** `docs/plans/2026-01-27-cookie-banner-design.md`

### 2. Privacy Policy Content (Merged with Cookie Policy)

Reviewed WordPress privacy and cookie policies, created simplified V1.0 version.

**Key changes from WordPress:**
- Merged 2 pages into 1 (`/privacybeleid`)
- Removed Google Analytics references (not used in V1.0)
- Removed Real Cookie Banner plugin references
- Simplified Article 8 (Cookies) - essential only
- Removed "surfgedrag" tracking mention (no analytics)

**Content file:** `content/privacybeleid.md`
