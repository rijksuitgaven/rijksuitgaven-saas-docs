## Key Decisions Made

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection
**Decision:** Python + FastAPI + Next.js + Railway + Typesense

**Context:**
- User requirements: Beginner-friendly, €50-200/month budget, 1-2 month timeline, MCP support
- Current pain points: 5s page loads, 5s search, no AI capabilities
- Team: 2-3 people, beginner/intermediate skill level, some Railway experience

**Rationale:**
- **Python:** Best for AI/data work, MCP SDK available, excellent libraries (Pandas, LangChain)
- **FastAPI:** Modern, fast (async), automatic API docs, easy to learn, Railway-ready
- **Next.js:** Industry standard, excellent docs, SSR performance, huge community
- **Railway:** GUI-based (user preference), simple deployment, within budget
- **Typesense:** 50x faster than MySQL FULLTEXT, simpler than Elasticsearch, cost-effective

**Cost:** €89-152/month (well within €180 budget, leaving €28-91 buffer)

**Consequences:**
- Learning curve for Python (if team doesn't know it)
- New deployment platform (Railway vs current hosting)
- Multiple languages (Python backend, TypeScript frontend)

**Status:** Awaiting user approval

---

### ADR-002: Migration Strategy - Phased Approach
**Decision:** Phase 1 = Keep MySQL, Phase 2 = Consider PostgreSQL

**Context:**
- 30 paying customers requiring zero downtime
- Complex database with 2GB data and 3-table pattern
- Need fast time-to-market (1-2 months)

**Rationale:**
- Minimize data migration risk
- Validate new architecture with production data
- Faster to launch
- Easy rollback if issues

**Consequences:**
- New platform reads existing MySQL initially
- Schema optimization deferred to Phase 2
- Must design for eventual PostgreSQL migration

**Status:** Recommended, awaiting approval

---

### ADR-003: Search Engine - Typesense over Elasticsearch
**Decision:** Use Typesense for search

**Context:**
- Current MySQL FULLTEXT search: 5 seconds
- Budget constraint: €50-200/month total
- Team skill level: Beginner/intermediate
- Dataset: 2GB, 2.1M universal search rows

**Rationale:**
- **Cost:** €15-25/month vs Elasticsearch €50-100/month
- **Simplicity:** Single binary vs complex Java cluster
- **Performance:** <100ms search (50x improvement)
- **Features:** Typo tolerance, faceted search, vector search support
- **Maintenance:** GUI-based, easier debugging

**Consequences:**
- Less powerful than Elasticsearch for extreme scale
- Smaller community (but growing fast)
- Fine for current and projected growth (10GB, 10K users)

**Status:** Recommended, awaiting approval

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Git Authentication Failure
**Issue:** `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`
**Solution:** Used GitHub CLI token authentication
```bash
git remote set-url origin "https://$(gh auth token)@github.com/..."
```
**Outcome:** Successful push to repository

### Problem 2: Incorrect Tool Assumption (SequelAce)
**Issue:** Created export commands for SequelAce/terminal, but user only has PhpMyAdmin access
**Solution:** Completely rewrote EXPORT-COMMANDS.md with GUI-based PhpMyAdmin instructions
**Outcome:** User successfully exported all required files
**Learning:** Always confirm exact tools/access before providing instructions

### Problem 3: Performance Bottleneck Root Cause
**Issue:** 5-second search times on 2GB database
**Investigation:** Analyzed schema, indexes, table structure
**Root Cause:** MySQL FULLTEXT search on 2.1M row universal_search table with longtext fields
**Solution:** Recommended Typesense dedicated search engine (50x faster)
**Outcome:** Architecture recommendation addresses this

## Discussions & Clarifications

### User Confirmed:
1. **3-table pattern:** "for each module is the source, the consolidated pivot by Ontvanger and a pivot by ontvanger"
2. **Budget:** Currently €180/month for WordPress hosting
3. **Timeline:** ASAP, 1-2 months ideal
4. **Team:** 2-3 people, medium skill level, some Railway experience
5. **Priority:** MCP server support for AI integration is critical
6. **Biggest concern:** Cost overruns
7. **Access:** PhpMyAdmin only (no terminal access to database)
8. **Preference:** GUI-based tools over command-line/IaC

### User Preferences:
- Python for backend (best for AI/data work)
- Open to Next.js for frontend
- Prefer Railway (has some experience)
- Keep MySQL initially, maybe PostgreSQL later
- Need both OpenAI and Claude for AI
- Want cost controls to prevent budget overruns

## Notes

### Important Context for Next Session:
- All analysis complete, ready for implementation planning
- User has PhpMyAdmin access only (no terminal to production DB)
- 30 paying customers require zero downtime during migration
- Budget is firm: €50-200/month, currently spending €180
- Timeline is aggressive: 1-2 months to V1
- MCP server support is non-negotiable requirement
