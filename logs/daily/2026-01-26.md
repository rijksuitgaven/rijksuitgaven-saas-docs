## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Railway Custom Domain Documentation

Corrected DNS setup instructions across all documentation. Railway custom domains require:
1. Add domain in Railway dashboard first
2. Railway provides unique CNAME target (e.g., `j65ghs38.up.railway.app`)
3. Use Railway-provided target in DNS CNAME record

Previous incorrect documentation pointed CNAME directly to app URL.
