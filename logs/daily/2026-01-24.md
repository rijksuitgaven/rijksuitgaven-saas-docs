## Work Completed

### 1. Apparaat Typesense Search Decision (Brainstorm)

Resolved pending decision on whether/how to include Apparaat in global search.

| Decision | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Include in global search? | Yes - mixed results with other modules |
| Primary search field | `kostensoort` (weight: 100) |
| Secondary search field | `begrotingsnaam` (weight: 50) |
| First table column | Kostensoort (replaces Ontvanger) |
| Expandable row grouping | User chooses: Begrotingsnaam (default), Artikel, Detail |

**Key insight:** Apparaat works exactly like other modules, just with Kostensoort instead of Ontvanger. Same DataTable component, same patterns.

### 2. Typesense Implementation Fix (PM Rule #9)

Discovered that Apparaat design was documented but NOT implemented. Fixed:

| File | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| `collections.json` | Missing id field, wrong schema | Updated to match design |
| `sync_to_typesense.py` | No `index_apparaat` function | Added function + tests |

**PM Rule #9 added:** "Verify implementation before moving on" - never mark a decision resolved until code/config files match the design.
